# Security Policy

PromptCadence is part of the Local AI Suite, whose default posture is local-first: it binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default, requires no credentials on loopback, and reaches a model only through a
configured LoadCoach — never a provider directly. See the security standards for the full
trust-boundary model and 0014 authentication strategy and 0026 local http hardening for the
authentication and LAN-exposure design this component follows.

PromptCadence concentrates the two riskiest behaviours in the suite — executing model-directed
tool calls, and sending data to paid remote providers — so its security posture is the strictest
in the suite. Phase 1 ships neither behaviour yet; both arrive under the governance machinery
specified in `docs/apps/promptcadence/spec.md` §14.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected security vulnerability.

Instead, report it privately to the maintainer with:

* A description of the issue and its potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce, including the configuration used (especially `server.host`,
  `server.allow_lan_exposure`, and any `[loadcoach]` or `[tiers.*]` configuration).
* The component version (`promptcadence --version`).

You should expect an acknowledgement within a reasonable time and, once a fix is available, credit
in the release notes unless you ask otherwise.

## Scope

In scope: this repository's own code and its documented configuration surface. Vulnerabilities in
LoadCoach, in the operating system, or in a third-party dependency should be reported to that
project directly — `pip-audit` runs in this repository's CI to catch known vulnerable dependency
versions.

## Security-relevant design decisions

This component follows these security rules:

* security standards — trust boundaries, network exposure, input validation, filesystem safety,
  secrets handling.
* 0014 authentication strategy — bearer tokens, scopes, loopback-vs-LAN behaviour.
* 0026 local http hardening — Host header validation, CSRF, outbound-fetch allowlisting.
* 0045 promptcadence reaches models only through loadcoach — no direct provider access, ever.
