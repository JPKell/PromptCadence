"""tests/unit/test_readme_version.py — the README's stated version cannot drift from `__about__`.

An operator reads the README's status line to know what they are about to install. Nothing bound
that line to the package's actual version, so a release could bump `__about__.__version__` and
leave the README naming an older one — which is exactly what the M9 re-audit found across the
suite (row L7). This test parses the version the README states after its `Status:` line and
asserts it against `promptcadence.__about__.__version__`.
