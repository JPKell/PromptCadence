"""Gold standard G16: the declared dependency budget matches gold-standards.md §1.1.

ADR-0114 makes the dependency budget the enumerated set a component declares, not a count. Adding
a name to the set below needs an ADR; removing one needs only a release. A version-range change
is neither, and does not move this test. gold-standards.md §1.1 enumerates the non-suite
dependencies PromptCadence is entitled to beyond the suite packages it imports; this reads the
component's own `pyproject.toml` and proves the two have not drifted apart.
