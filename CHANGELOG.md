## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 1: skeleton, configuration, database and honest-degradation health.
  - `config.py`: the full spec §12 surface (server, storage, loadcoach, planning, approval,
    execution, budget incl. `[budget.projects.*]`, tools, compaction, `[tiers.*]`, policy,
    logging) with the full file -> environment -> CLI precedence chain, and every startup
    refusal from spec §12 and ADR-0026/ADR-0047/ADR-0049.
  - `infrastructure/db/models.py` and migration `0001`: `trajectories`, `threads`, `turns`,
    `events`, `api_tokens`, `settings`, on `weightsdb`. `turns` carries the optional LA0 adapter
    fields from birth (adapter-roadmap §4.5).
  - `web/app.py`: MirrorWall's request-ID and Host-validation middleware and the standard error
    envelope; `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/version`, `GET /api/v1/system/status`.
  - `cli/`: `serve`, `health`, `doctor`, `version`, `config show|validate|init|path`,
    `db upgrade|status|backup|restore`.
  - `.importlinter`: the standard `web`/`cli`/`services`/`domain` layering, plus a dedicated
    contract forbidding `modelrack` and `sweatmeter` imports anywhere in the package
    (ADR-0045 rule 2) — written now so no later phase can add either import casually.
